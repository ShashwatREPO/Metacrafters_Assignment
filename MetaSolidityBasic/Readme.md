# Soulbound Token

## overview 
This was a project assigned to me by Metacrafter in their course "ETH Proof for Beginners," where I have to create a Solidity smart contract with basic functions for minting and burning a token.

## Requirements
- Public Variables: The contract includes public variables to store details about the token: Token Name, Token Abbreviation, and Total Supply.
- Address to Balance Mapping: A mapping to track the balances of different addresses.
- Mint Function: A function to mint new tokens, increasing the total supply and the balance of a specified address.
- Burn Function: A function to burn tokens, decreasing the total supply and the balance of a specified address. It includes a check to ensure the address has 
  sufficient balance.
  
## Learning Outcomes
- solidity basics
- contract structure
- how to use and create functions
- how to use mapping
- how to use access modifiers
  
## Conclusion
This project provided a hands-on introduction to writing a simple token contract in Solidity and taught how to write solidity smart contracts.
